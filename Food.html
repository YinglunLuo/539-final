            <h2>Beijing's Food</h2>
            <p>Beijing cuisine, also known as Jing cuisine, Mandarin cuisine and Peking cuisine and formerly as Beiping cuisine, is the local cuisine of Beijing, the national capital of China.<br>
            As Beijing has been the capital of China for centuries, its cuisine is influenced by culinary traditions from all over China, but the style that has the greatest influence on Beijing cuisine is that of the eastern coastal province of Shandong. Beijing cuisine has itself, in turn, also greatly influenced other Chinese cuisines, particularly the cuisine of Liaoning, the Chinese imperial cuisine and the Chinese aristocrat cuisine

                            <h2>Roast Duck</h2>
                            <p>Beijing roast duck, or Peking Duck, is the epitome of Beijing cuisine and the dish you must try when visiting Beijing. The dish is mostly esteemed for the thin, crispy skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly skin and little meat.<br>
                            While sauces and accompaniments will vary between restaurants (the most common being scallion and cucumber) it is difficult to go wrong with roast duck in Beijing. If you eat at one of Beijing’s more famous duck restaurants it will also be accompanied by a short demonstration on the correct way to assemble a Peking Duck wrap using chopsticks.</p>

                            <p>Jiaozi is another dish that can be found anywhere across Beijing and while there are a number of better-known dumpling restaurants and chains, some of the tastiest dumplings (and most interesting experiences) can be found in smaller, less conspicuous family eateries where dumplings are the only thing on the menu. At these restaurants you can often sit and watch the next batch of dumplings being rolled and filled as you eat. A plate of Jiaozi with a soy sauce, vinegar and chili dip is synonymous with Northern Chinese cuisine.</p>

                            It has three main ingredients: wide hand-pulled noodles, vegetable pieces, and pork. Vegetables vary seasonally, but there are never less than seven kinds. It is an ideal lunch time snack for visitors short on time as it is usually ready seconds after you order. As an added bonus it is very inexpensive.

                            Traditional hotpot restaurants will involve sitting around a large pot of boiling soup, in which you cook your own food. Although Mongolian hotpot usually involves a large amount of lamb, any number of meats, vegetables and breads are available. These are sliced thin to ensure they cook quickly and evenly.<br>

                            <p>Originating in the city of Baoding in northern Hebei province, Beijing has adopted the donkey burger as its own. Restaurants offering this dish serve a number of different donkey meals, however the one to try is the donkey burger. Shredded donkey meat is served in a piping-hot, crunchy bun with a green pepper relish.<br>

                            The contrast between the succulent meat, crunchy bun and sweet relish make it incredibly tasty and you are unlikely to stop at one. Look out for a big donkey meat sign clearly visible on the front of all restaurants offering this meat.</p>

                            <p>The literal translation of this dish ‘dry wok potato wedges’ offers diners a fairly accurate idea of what to expect.<br>
                            Slices of potato, crispy pork and chilies simmer in an iron pot sat atop an open flame. As you are working your way through the meat and potatoes, the bed of sliced onions that is hidden underneath slowly caramelizes in oil, leaving you with a delicious snack to finish your meal on.</p>

Don't be fooled by the plain look of the potatoes as they are coated in a sweet gloss which give the dish its flavor.</p>
